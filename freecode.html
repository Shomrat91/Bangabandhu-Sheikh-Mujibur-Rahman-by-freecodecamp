After three days of meetings, the talks failed. On February 13, President Yahya Khan convened a meeting of the National Assembly in Dhaka on March 3. On February 15, Bhutto announced a boycott of the National Assembly meeting in Dhaka and demanded the transfer of power to the two majorities in the two provinces. In a statement on February 16, Bangabandhu strongly criticized Mr. Bhutto's claim and said, "Bhutto's claim is completely unreasonable. Power should be handed over to Awami League, the only majority party. The people of East Bengal now own the power. On March 1, Yahya Khan announced the suspension of the meeting of the National Assembly for an indefinite period, and there was a storm of protest throughout Bengal.

I will free the people of this country, God willing. … Everyone builds a fort from house to house. One has to deal with everything one has.” He urged to prepare for guerrilla warfare against the enemy. Bangabandhu called for a non-cooperation movement against Yahya Khan's government. On the one hand, President General Yahya's orders were given, on the other hand, Bangabandhu's orders were given from Dhanmondi Road No. 32, the people of Bengal followed Bangabandhu's orders. Offices-courts, banks-insurance, schools-colleges, cars, industries-factories all obeyed Bangabandhu's orders. The unprecedented response of the people of Bengal to the non-cooperation movement by disobeying all the orders of Yahya is a rare event in history. Originally from March 7 to March 25, Bangladesh was ruled by Bangabandhu as an independent country. On March 16, the Mujib-Yahia meeting began in Dhaka regarding the transfer of power. Mr. Bhutto also came to Dhaka for discussion. Yahya-Mujib-Bhutto talks took place till March 24. Yahya left Dhaka in the evening after talks failed on March 25.

This may be my last message, from today Bangladesh is independent. I call upon the people of Bangladesh wherever you might be and with whatever you have, to resist the army of occupation to the last. Your fight must go on until the last soldier of the Pakistan occupation army is expelled from the soil of Bangladesh. Final victory is ours.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman

Translation: 'Perhaps this is my last message, Bangladesh is independent from today. I appeal to the people of Bangladesh to resist the occupying forces till the last moment with whatever you have and wherever you are. Until the last man of the Pakistani occupation forces is expelled from the soil of Bangladesh and until final victory is achieved, you must continue the war.'] This announcement was sent on transmitters all over Bangladesh.

Our freedom fighters are bravely fighting the enemy to liberate the motherland. My appeal and command to you in the name of Almighty Allah is to continue fighting till the last drop of blood to liberate the country. Ask the help of Police, EPR, Bengal Regiment and Ansar to come and fight by your side. There is no compromise. Victory will be ours. Drive out the last enemy from the holy motherland. Convey this news to all Awami League leaders and workers and other patriotic dear people. May Allah bless you. Jai Bangla.

For the crime of declaring independence, Bangabandhu was arrested in 1-10 minutes from residence No. 32 in Dhanmondi and taken to Dhaka Cantonment and on March 26 he was taken to Pakistan as a prisoner. On March 26, J. Yahya declared the Awami League banned in a speech and called Bangabandhu a traitor.

Bangladesh gained independence. Before that, on September 7, Bangabandhu was tried in a secret trial in Pakistan's Lyallpur Military Jail and was declared a traitor and sentenced to death. The freedom-loving people of different countries and the world demanded the safety of Bangabandhu's life. On December 27, the Bangladesh government demanded the immediate unconditional release of the father of the nation, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Various countries and international organizations, including India and the Soviet Union, urged the Pakistan government to release Bangabandhu and said that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is the president of independent Bangladesh. He is the architect of Bangladesh, so Pakistan has no right to detain him. Bangladesh has already been recognized by many countries.
